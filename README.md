### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Bhavya Mehta

I am working as a full-stack web developer, mainly in the MERN stack. I love building products and that's what makes me get up from bed each day. If you need help with your product or are looking for a consultant to help you with React, I'd be happy to help out. 

Within the organizations I have served, I have consistently delivered high-quality software, solved critical problems and been at the forefront of developing products from scratch. This has helped me gain a deeper understanding of not just the technical skills but other vital skills like project management, business requirement analysis and client interaction. These responsiblities have made me a quick learner with a highly adaptable mindset, and furthermore have increased my ability to deliver the expected, in due time all while meeting the industry standards.

Apart from that I love to volunteer and teach. I have worked with multiple NGO's as a coding facilator and also taught Mathematics to over 250 1oth std students till now.
