### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Bhavya Mehta

I am no wizard, but I assure you I can create magic when I write code. I am mainly proficient in the MERN stack and Web3. I love building products and that's what makes me get up from bed each day. If you need help with your product or are looking for a consultant to help you with Web Development or with Web3 Development, I'd be happy to help out.

Within the organizations I have served, I have consistently delivered high-quality software, solved critical problems, and been at the forefront of developing products from scratch. This has helped me gain a deeper understanding of not just technical skills but other vital skills like project management, business requirement analysis, and client interaction. These responsibilities have made me a quick learner with a highly adaptable mindset and furthermore have increased my ability to deliver the expected, in due time all while meeting the industry standards.

Apart from that, I love to volunteer and teach. I have worked with multiple NGOs as a coding facilitator and also taught Mathematics to over 250 10th-standard students till now.
